0.8.0 -> 0.9.0
  * automake build system
    libMesh-specific implementation features:
    source and header files must be listed explicitly.
    When adding a header file,
      1.) svn add the file
      2.) cd include ; ./rebuild_include_HEADERS.sh
      3.) cd include/libmesh ; ./rebuild_makefile.sh
    When adding a soure file,
      1.) svn add the file
      2.) cd src ; ./rebuild_libmesh_la_SOURCES.sh
    General notes:
      o make install && make installcheck
        installs the built library & performs sanity checking
      o make distcheck
        packages up a tarball and tests it for self-sufficiency.
	always do this when modifying the build system.
      o for more information, view the README and INSTALL files.
  * VariableGroups DofObject storage optimization for the common
    case of multiple Variables of the same type within a System.
    Note this changes the default variable ordering within a
    System - the old format is available via System::identify_variable_groups()
  * TecplotIO binary format updated to support v11.2 features where
    available.  This includes encoding the solution time into output files,
    writing each libMesh subdomain to a separate Tecplot zone, and support
    for 1D Tecplot binary files.
  * ./configure'able support for identifier types. Defaults:
         id size (boundaries)............. : 2 bytes
         id size (dofs)................... : 4 bytes
         id size (processors)............. : 2 bytes
         id size (subdomains)............. : 2 bytes
