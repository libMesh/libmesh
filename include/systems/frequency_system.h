/**
 * \p FrequencySystem provides a specific system class
 * for frequency-dependent (linear) systems.
 * Generally two solution flavors are possible:
 *
 * - @e fast solution of moderately-sized systems:
 *   For moderate numbers of dof, it is possible to keep
 *   frequency-independent matrices in memory.  For this,
 *   simply provide multiple frequencies prior to \p ini().
 *   Also provide functions \p _assemble_fptr and \p _solve_fptr
 *   that should compute the element contributions, and simply add
 *   these contributions to give the frequency-dependent overall
 *   matrix, respectively. For details see the examples section.
 *
 * - solution of @e large systems:
 *   When there is not enough space to keep the frequency-independent
 *   contributions in memory, the user need only provide a function
 *   \p _solve_fptr which assembles the overall, frequency-dependent
 *   matrix for the current frequency given in the parameter section
 *   of \p EquationSystems<FrequencySystem> named \p current \p frequency.
 *   For this to work, only provide @e one frequency.
