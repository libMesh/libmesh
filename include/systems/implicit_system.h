 * \brief Manages consistently variables, degrees of freedom, coefficient
 * vectors, and matrices for implicit systems.
 *
 * Implicit systems are characterized by the need to solve the (non-)linear
 * system Ax=b. This class provides, in addition to the ExplicitSystem class,
 * storage for sparse matrices. Hence this System provides means to manage a
 * right hand side vector and a sparse matrix. In addition, further matrices
 * can be managed using the ImplicitSystem::add_matrix method.
 *
 * This class provieds *no* means to solve the implicit system. This
 * functionality is provided, e.g., by the LinearImplicitSystem or the
 * NonlinearImplicitSystem class.
 *
 * \note Additional vectors/matrices can be added via parent class
 * interfaces.
