/**
 * This class creates quadrature points on a uniform grid, with
 * order+1 points on an edge.
 *
 * Unlike most libMesh quadrature rules, QGrid does *not* reduce
 * error exponentially on smooth functions as you increase the
 * quadrature order.  Instead, it reduces the error quadratically.
 * However, this error reduction is more reliable on non-smooth
 * functions.
 *
 * This quadrature type may be useful iff you are integrating
 * functions which have discontinuities or discontinuous derivatives
 * on scales smaller than your element size.
