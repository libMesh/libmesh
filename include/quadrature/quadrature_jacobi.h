/**
 * This class implements two (for now) Jacobi-Gauss quadrature
 * rules.  These rules have the same order of accuracy as the
 * normal Gauss quadrature rules, but instead of integrating
 * a weight function w(x)=1, they integrate w(x)=(1-x)^alpha * (1+x)^beta.
 * The reason that they are useful is that they allow you to
 * implement conical product rules for triangles and tetrahedra.
 * Although these product rules are non-optimal (use more points
 * than necessary) they are automatically constructable for high
 * orders of accuracy where other formulae may not exist.
 *
 * There is not much sense in using this class directly,
 * since it only provides 1D rules, weighted, as described before.
 * Still, this class is particularly helpful: check \p QGauss
 * for triangles and tetrahedra, with orders beyond \p THIRTIETH.
