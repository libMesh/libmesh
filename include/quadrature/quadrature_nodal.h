 * This class implements nodal quadrature rules for various element
 * types. For some element types, this corresponds to well-known
 * quadratures such as the trapezoidal rule and Simpson's rule. For
 * other element types (e.g. the serendipity QUAD8/HEX20/PRISM15) it
 * implements a lower-order-accurate nodal quadrature which still
 * generates a strictly positive definite (diagonal) mass matrix.
 * Since the main purpose of this class is provide appropriate nodal
 * quadrature rules, "order" arguments passed during initialization
 * are ignored.
