/**
 * This class implements the Grundmann-Moller quadrature rules for
 * tetrahedra.  The GM rules are well-defined for simplices of
 * arbitrary dimension and to any order, but the rules by Dunavant for
 * two-dimensional simplices are in general superior.  This is primarily
 * due to the fact that the GM rules contain a significant proportion
 * of negative weights, making them susceptible to round-off error
 * at high-order.
 *
 * The GM rules are interesting in 3D because they overlap with the
 * conical product rules at higher order while having significantly
 * fewer evaluation points, making them potentially much more
 * efficient.  The table below gives a comparison between the number
 * of points in a conical product (CP) rule and the GM rule of
 * equivalent order.  The GM rules are defined to be exact for
 * polynomials of degree d=2*s+1, s=0,1,2,3,... The table also gives
 * the percentage of each GM rule's weights which are negative.
 * The percentage of negative weights appears to approach 50, and the
 * amplification factor (a measure of the effect of round-off) defined
 * as
 *
 * amp. factor = \f$ \frac{1}{V} \sum \|w_i\|, \f$
 *
 * where V is the volume of the reference element, grows like exp(C*s).
 * (A rule with all positive weights has an amplification factor of
 * 1.0 by definition.)
