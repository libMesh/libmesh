/**
 * This class defines alternate quadrature rules on
 * "tensor-product" elements (QUADs and HEXes) which can be
 * useful when integrating monomial finite element bases.
 *
 * While tensor product rules are ideal for integrating
 * bi/tri-linear, bi/tri-quadratic, etc. (i.e. tensor product)
 * bases (which consist of incomplete polynomials up to degree=
 * dim*p) they are not optimal for the MONOMIAL or FEXYZ bases,
 * which consist of complete polynomials of degree=p.
 *
 * This class is implemented to provide quadrature rules which are
 * more efficient than tensor product rules when they are available,
 * and fall back on Gaussian quadrature rules when necessary.
 *
 * A number of these rules have been helpfully collected in electronic form by:
 *
 * Prof. Ronald Cools
 * Katholieke Universiteit Leuven,
 * Dept. Computerwetenschappen
 * http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~nines/research/ecf/ecf.html
 *
 * (A username and password to access the tables is available by request.)
 *
 * We also provide the original reference for each rule, as available,
 * in the source code file.

   * 38-point rule and their degree 8, 47-point rule.  The others either contain negative weights or points
   * outside the reference interval.  The points and weights, to 32 digits, were obtained from:
   * Ronald Cools' website (http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~nines/research/ecf/ecf.html) and
   * the unique permutations of G^{rot} were computed by me [JWP] using Maple.
