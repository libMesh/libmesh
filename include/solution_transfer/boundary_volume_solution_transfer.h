 * we must have either:
 *
 * .) Transfer from the boundary of a VolumeMesh to its associated
 *    BoundaryMesh, or
 * .) Transfer from a BoundaryMesh to its corresponding VolumeMesh.
 *
 * Because of this assumption, we can use the interior_parent() to
 * directly define the mapping between solutions.  The transfer()
 * function internally determines which direction the transfer is
 * going, and calls the appropriate algorithm internally.
