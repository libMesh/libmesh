/**
 * A specific instatiation of the \p FEBase class. This
 * class is templated, and specific template instantiations
 * will result in different Infinite Element families, similar
 * to the \p FE class.  \p InfFE builds a \p FE<Dim-1,T_base>,
 * and most of the requests related to the base are handed over
 * to this object.  All methods related to the radial part
 * are collected in the nested class \p Radial.  Similarly,
 * most of the static methods concerning base approximation
 * are contained in \p Base.
 *
 * Having different shape approximation families in radial direction
 * introduces the requirement for an additional \p Order in this
 * class. Therefore, the \p FEType internals change when infinite
 * elements are enabled.
 * When the specific infinite element type is not known at compile
 * time, use the \p FEBase::build() member to create abstract
 * (but still optimized) infinite elements at run time.
 *
 * The @e node numbering scheme is the one from the current
 * infinite element.  Each node in the base holds exactly
 * the same number of dofs as an adjacent conventional \p FE
 * would contain.  The nodes further out hold the additional
 * dof necessary for radial approximation.  The order of the outer nodes'
 * components is such that the radial shapes have highest
 * priority, followed by the base shapes.
