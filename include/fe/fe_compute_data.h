 * class \p FEComputeData hides arbitrary data to be passed to and from

 * the finite element level, while maintaining library integrity.
 * - With special finite elements disabled (like infinite elements),
 *   this class wraps the return values of all shape functions
 *   from \p FEInterface::shape() in a \p std::vector<Number>.
 * - With infinite elements enabled, this class returns a vector of physically
 *   correct shape functions, both for finite and infinite elements.
