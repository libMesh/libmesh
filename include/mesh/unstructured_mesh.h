  /**
   * Stitch \p other_mesh to this mesh so that this mesh is the union of the two meshes.
   * \p this_mesh_boundary and \p other_mesh_boundary are used to specify a dim-1 dimensional
   * surface on which we seek to merge any "overlapping" nodes, where we use the parameter
   * \p tol as a relative tolerance (relative to the smallest edge length on the surfaces
   * being stitched) to determine whether or not nodes are overlapping.
   * If \p clear_stitched_boundary_ids==true, this function clears boundary_info IDs in this
   * mesh associated \p this_mesh_boundary and \p other_mesh_boundary.
   * If \p use_binary_search is true, we use an optimized "sort then binary search" algorithm
   * for finding matching nodes. Otherwise we use a N^2 algorithm (which can be more reliable
   * at dealing with slightly misaligned meshes).
   * If \p enforce_all_nodes_match_on_boundaries is true, we throw an error if the number of
   * nodes on the specified boundaries don't match the number of nodes that were merged.
   * This is a helpful error check in some cases. If this is true, it overrides the value of
   * \p merge_boundary_nodes_all_or_nothing.
   * If \p skip_find_neighbors is true, a faster stitching method is used, where the lists of
   * neighbors for each elements are copied as well and patched, without calling the time-consuming
   * find_neighbors() function. This option is now hard-coded to true.
   * If \p merge_boundary_nodes_all_or_nothing is true, instead of throwing an error
   * like \p enforce_all_nodes_match_on_boundaries, the meshes are combined anyway but coincident
   * nodes are not merged into single nodes. This is useful in cases where you are not sure if the
   * boundaries are fully conforming beforehand and you want to handle the non-conforming cases
   * differently.
   *
   * Note that the element IDs for elements in the stitched mesh corresponding to "this" mesh
   * will be unchanged. The IDs for elements corresponding to \p other_mesh will be incremented
   * by this->max_elem_id().
   *
   * There is no simple a priori relationship between node IDs in "this" mesh
   * and other_mesh and node IDs in the stitched mesh because the number of nodes (and hence
   * the node IDs) in the stitched mesh depend on how many nodes are stitched.
   *
   * If \p remap_subdomain_ids is true then we assume that some
   * subdomain ids might have been autogenerated, so we remap them as
   * necessary, treating subdomain names as the important thing for
   * consistency; if we have missing names and cannot infer a
   * consistent resolution to an id conflict then we exit with an
   * error.  If \p remap_subdomain_ids is false then we revert to the
   * older libMesh behavior: leave all subdomain ids alone and woe
   * unto you if you weren't keeping track of them.
   *
   * If \p prepare_after_stitching is true then we prepare the newly
   * stitched mesh for use immediately after stitching.  If the mesh
   * does not need to be completely prepared for use yet (e.g. because
   * it will undergo further stitching etc. before repartitioning for
   * load balancing is desired), this can be set to false to
   * potentially improve performance.
   *
   * \returns the count of how many nodes were merged between the two meshes.
   * This can be zero in the case of no matching nodes or if
   * \p merge_boundary_nodes_all_or_nothing was active and relevant.
