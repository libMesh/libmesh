 * In order to use the adaptive mesh refinement capabilities
 * of the library, first instantiate a MeshRefinement object
 * with a reference to this class.  Then call the appropriate
 * refinement functions from that object.  To interact with the
 * boundary, instantiate a BoundaryMesh with a reference to
 * this class, and then use that object's functionality.
