 * and to close those libraries when it goes out of scope.  It also

 * The \p LibMeshInit class, when constructed, initializes

 * command line parsing needed by libMesh.  The LibMeshInit
 * destructor closes those libraries properly.
 *
 * For most users, a single LibMeshInit object should be created at
 * the start of your main() function.
 *
 * All libMesh functionality should be used only when a LibMeshInit
 * object exists.  Dependent library functionality, likewise, except
 * in codes which manually initialize those libraries before
 * LibMeshInit creation and finalize them after LibMeshInit
 * destruction.
 *
 * Since "it is best not to perform much more than a return rc after
 * calling MPI_Finalize", applications which want to do anything after
 * LibMeshInit destruction should manage MPI initialization and
 * finalization manually.
