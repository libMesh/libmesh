/**
 * This class implements reference counting. Any class that
 * is properly derived from this class will get reference counted, provided
 * that the library is configured with \p --enable-reference-counting
 * and you are compiling with \p DEBUG defined.
 * For example, the following is sufficient to define the class \p Foo
 * as a reference counted class:
 *
 * \code
 * class Foo : public ReferenceCountedObject<Foo>
 * {
 *  public:
 *
 *    Foo  () {}
 *
 *    ~Foo () {}
 *
 *    void bar ();
 *
 *  private:
 * };
 *
 * \endcode
 *
 * \par
 * If the library is configured with \p --disable-reference-counting
 * or \p DEBUG is not defined then this class does nothing.
 * All members are inlined and empty, so they should effectively disappear.
 *
