/**
 * This class wraps another UnsteadySolver derived class, and compares
 * the results of timestepping with deltat and timestepping with
 * 2*deltat to adjust future timestep lengths.
 *
 * Currently this class only works on fully coupled Systems
 *
 * This class is part of the new DifferentiableSystem framework,
 * which is still experimental.  Users of this framework should
 * beware of bugs and future API changes.
