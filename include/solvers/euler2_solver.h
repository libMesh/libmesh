/**
 * This class defines a theta-method (defaulting to Backward
 * Euler with theta = 1.0) solver to handle
 * time integration of DifferentiableSystems.
 * The "Euler2" solver differs from Euler in how it evaluates
 * residuals at intermediate theta values:
 * Euler solves m(u,u') = f(theta*u_new + (1-theta)*u_old),
 * Euler2 solves m(u') = theta*f(u_new) + (1-theta)*f(u_old)
 * i.e. the trapezoidal rule for theta = 0.5
 *
 * This class is part of the new DifferentiableSystem framework,
 * which is still experimental.  Users of this framework should
 * beware of bugs and future API changes.
