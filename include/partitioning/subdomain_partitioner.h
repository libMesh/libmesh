/**
 * The \p SubdomainPartitioner partitions the elements in "chunks" of
 * user-specified subdomain ids.  Once all the chunks are partitioned,
 * the overall mesh partitioning is simply the union of the chunk
 * partitionings. For example, if the "chunks" vector is given by:
 * chunks[0] = {1, 2, 4}
 * chunks[1] = {3, 7, 8}
 * chunks[2] = {5, 6}
 * then we will call the internal Partitioner three times, once for
 * subdomains 1, 2, and 4, once for subdomains 3, 7, and 8, and once
 * for subdomains 5 and 6.
 *
 * \note This Partitioner may produce highly non-optimal communication
 * patterns and is likely to place geometrically disjoint sets of
 * elements on the same processor. Its intended use is to help
 * facilitate load balancing. That is, if the user knows that certain
 * subdomains (or groups of subdomains) are more expensive to compute
 * than others, he/she can ensure that they are partitioned more or
 * less evenly among the available processors by specifying them
 * together in a single entry of the "chunk" vector.
