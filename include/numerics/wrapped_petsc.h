   * 2.) It's not always safe to call non-Destroy() functions on PETSc objects
   *     which are about to be Destroy()ed, that is, we would have to check
   *     for nullptr, etc. which would lead to more complexity, and more code.
   *
   * One possible approach for extra error checking with immediate
   * abort on error:
   *
   * MPI_Comm comm;
   * PetscObjectGetComm((PetscObject)(&obj), &comm);
   * PetscErrorCode ierr = Type ## Destroy(&obj);
