/**
 * This class provides a specific system class.  It aims
 * to generalize any system, linear or nonlinear, which
 * provides both a residual and a Jacobian.
 * For first order (in time) systems, the (nonlinear)
 * residual computed at each time step is
 * \f[ F(u) + G(u) - M(u,\dot{u})\dot{u} = 0 \f]
 * for unsteady TimeSolver and \f$ F(u) = 0\f$ for steady
 * TimeSolver. \f$F(u)\f$ is computed by element/side_time_derivative,
 * \f$ G(u) \f$ is computed using element/side_constraint, and
 * \f$ M(u,\dot{u})\dot{u} \f$ is computed using the mass_residual
 * methods.
 *
 * For second order (in time) systems, the (nonlinear)
 * residual computed at each time step is
 * \f[ M(u,\ddot{u})\ddot{u} + C(u,\dot{u})\dot{u} + F(u) + G(u) = 0 \f]
 * for unsteady TimeSolver and \f$ F(u) = 0\f$ for steady
 * TimeSolver. \f$F(u)\f$ is computed by element/side_time_derivative,
 * \f$G(u)\f$ is computed using element/side_constraint,
 * \f$C(u,\dot{u})\dot{u}\f$ is computed using the dampling_residual methods
 * and \f$ -M(u,\ddot{u})\ddot{u}\f$ is computed using the mass_residual
 * methods. This is the sign convention used by the default implementation;
 * if the method is overridden, the user can choose any self-consistent sign
 * convention they wish.
 *
 * FEMContext provides methods for querying values of the solution \f${u}\f$,
 * its "rate" \f$\dot{u}\f$ and its "acceleration" \f$\ddot{u}\f$. Furthermore,
 * derivatives of each of these w.r.t the nonlinear iteration unknown (e.g. in
 * EulerSolver, the solution at the next time step \f$ u_{n+1} \f$) are provided
 * through DiffContext::get_elem_solution_derivative(),
 * DiffContext::get_elem_solution_rate_derivative(), and
 * DiffContext::get_elem_solution_accel_derivative(). The should be incorporated
 * into the Jacobian evaluations, if the Jacobian is being provided.
