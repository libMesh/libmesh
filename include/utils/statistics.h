/**
 * The StatisticsVector class is derived from
 * the std::vector<> and therefore has all of
 * its useful features.  It was designed
 * to not have any internal state, i.e. no
 * public or private data members.  Also,
 * it was only designed for classes and
 * types for which the operators +,*,/ have
 * meaining, specifically floats, doubles,
 * ints, etc.  The main reason for this design
 * decision was to allow a std::vector<> to
 * be successfully cast to a StatisticsVector,
 * thereby enabling its additional functionality.
 * We do not anticipate any problems with
 * deriving from an stl container which lacks
 * a virtual destructor in this case.
 *
 * Where manipulation of the data set was necessary
 * (for example sorting) two versions of member
 * functions have been implemented.  The non-const
 * versions perform sorting directly in the
 * data set, invalidating pointers and changing
 * the entries.  const versions of the same
 * functions are generally available, and will be
 * automatically invoked on const StatisticsVector objects.
 * A draw-back to the const versions is that they
 * simply make a copy of the original object and
 * therefore double the original memory requirement
 * for the data set.
 *
 * Most of the actual code was copied or adapted from
 * the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). More precisely,
 * the recursion relations for computing the mean were
 * implemented in order to avoid possible problems with
 * buffer overruns.
