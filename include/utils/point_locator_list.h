/**
 * This is a point locator.  It locates points in space
 * using a list of element centroids: given a mesh this
 * locator returns the element that is @e closest to the
 * given point in global coordinates.
 * Note that this may yield @e severe difficulties in
 * case of extremely distorted elements, e.g.\ infinite
 * elements.
 *
 * This list version is not efficient, but especially
 * @e reliable for the case of finding the @e closest
 * dim-1 element (nearest-surface-element, e.g. used
 * for projecting boundary conditions from a surface
 * mesh onto a volumetric mesh).
 * It should be noted that this class only works when
 * the element list in the associated mesh object is
 * @e not modified (like refinement etc).  Otherwise,
 * the point locator has to be cleared and re-initialized.
 * Use \p PointLocatorBase::build() to create objects
 * of this type at run time.
