 // <h1>Introduction Example 1 - Creation of a Mesh Object</h1>
 //
 // This is the first example program.  It simply demonstrates
 // how to create a mesh object.  A mesh is read from file,
 // information is printed to the screen, and the mesh is then
 // written.

 // C++ include files that we need
#include <iostream>
// Functions to initialize the library.
#include "libmesh/libmesh.h"
// Basic include files needed for the mesh functionality.
#include "libmesh/mesh.h"

// Bring in everything from the libMesh namespace
using namespace libMesh;

int main (int argc, char** argv)
{
  // Initialize the library.  This is necessary because the library
  // may depend on a number of other libraries (i.e. MPI and PETSc)
  // that require initialization before use.  When the LibMeshInit
  // object goes out of scope, other libraries and resources are
  // finalized.
  LibMeshInit init (argc, argv);

  // Check for proper usage. The program is designed to be run
  // as follows:
  // ./ex1 -d DIM input_mesh_name [-o output_mesh_name]
  // where [output_mesh_name] is an optional parameter giving
  // a filename to write the mesh into.
  if (argc < 4)
    {
      if (libMesh::processor_id() == 0)
        std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " -d 2 in.mesh [-o out.mesh]"
                  << std::endl;

      // This handy function will print the file name, line number,
      // and then abort.  Currently the library does not use C++
      // exception handling.
      libmesh_error();
    }

  // Get the dimensionality of the mesh from argv[2]
  const unsigned int dim = std::atoi(argv[2]);

  // Skip higher-dimensional examples on a lower-dimensional libMesh build
  libmesh_example_assert(dim <= LIBMESH_DIM, "2D/3D support");

  // Create a mesh, with dimension to be overridden later, on the
  // default MPI communicator.
  Mesh mesh(init.comm());

  // Read the input mesh.
  mesh.read (argv[3]);

  // Print information about the mesh to the screen.
  mesh.print_info();

  // Write the output mesh if the user specified an
  // output file name.
  if (argc >= 6 && std::string("-o") == argv[4])
    mesh.write (argv[5]);

  // All done.  libMesh objects are destroyed here.  Because the
  // LibMeshInit object was created first, its destruction occurs
  // last, and it's destructor finalizes any external libraries and
  // checks for leaked memory.
  return 0;
}
