 // <h1>Introduction Example 2 - Defining a Simple System</h1>
 //
 // This is the second example program.  It demonstrates how to
 // create an equation system for a simple scalar system.  This
 // example will also introduce some of the issues involved with using PETSc
 // in your application.
 //
 // This is the first example program that indirectly
 // uses the PETSc library.  By default equation data is stored
 // in PETSc vectors, which may span multiple processors.  Before
 // PETSc is used it must be initialized via libMesh::init().  Note that
 // by passing argc and argv to PETSc you may specify
 // command line arguments to PETSc.  For example, you might
 // try running this example as:
 //
 // ./introduction_ex2 -log_info
 //
 // to see what PETSc is doing behind the scenes or
 //
 // ./introduction_ex2 -log_summary
 //
 // to get a summary of what PETSc did.
 // Among other things, libMesh::init() initializes the MPI
 // communications library and PETSc numeric library on your system if
 // you haven't already done so.

// C++ include files that we need
#include <iostream>
//Basic include file needed for the mesh functionality.
#include "libmesh/libmesh.h"
#include "libmesh/mesh.h"
// Include file that defines various mesh generation utilities
#include "libmesh/mesh_generation.h"
// Include file that defines (possibly multiple) systems of equations.
#include "libmesh/equation_systems.h"
// Include files that define a simple steady system
#include "libmesh/linear_implicit_system.h"
#include "libmesh/transient_system.h"
#include "libmesh/explicit_system.h"

  // Later on, other flavors of systems will be introduced.  For the
