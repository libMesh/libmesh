/**
 * The Biharmonic class encapsulates most of the data structures
 * necessary to calculate the biharmonic residual and Jacobian,
 * auxiliary quantities, to take a timestep, and to output the state --
 * biharmonic solution and vectors of auxiliary quantities.
 *
 * The main reason for this design is to have a data structure that
 * has all of the necessary data in one place, where all of the
 * calculation subroutines can access these data. Currently these data
 * are split up among several interdependent objects with no clear
 * hierarchy between them: mesh, equation system, equation system
 * bundle, residual/Jacobian calculator.
 *
 * Since no object contains all others and the data are distributed
 * among many objects, the natural control and data flow resides outside
 * of these objects and is typically implemented in main().  We,
 * however, would like to split the calculation into natural chunks --
 * subroutines -- while retaining these subroutines access to the common
 * necessary data -- biharmonic parameters, mesh and time interval
 * sizes, etc. Thus, class Biharmonic.  Finally, making Biharmonic
 * inherit from EquationSystems makes it possible to include it in the
 * most common callbacks that do not pass back a user context, but only
 * an EquationSystems object.
