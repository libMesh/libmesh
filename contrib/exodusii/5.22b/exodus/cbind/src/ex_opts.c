The function ex_opts() is used to set message reporting options.

\return In case of an error, ex_opts() returns a negative number; a warning
        will return a positive number.

\param[in] options   Integer option value. Current options are shown in the table below.

<table>
<tr><td> \c EX_ABORT  </td><td> Causes fatal errors to force program 
                                exit. (Default is false.) </td></tr>
<tr><td> \c EX_DEBUG  </td><td> Causes certain messages to print 
                                for debug use. (Default is false.)</td></tr>
<tr><td> \c EX_VERBOSE</td><td> Causes all error messages to print when true, 
                                otherwise no error messages will print. (Default is false.)</td></tr>
</table>

\note Values may be OR'ed together to provide any combination 
      of these capabilities.

For example, the following will cause all messages to print 
and will cause the program to exit upon receipt of fatal error:

\code
#include "exodusII.h"
ex_opts(EX_ABORT|EX_VERBOSE);
\endcode
