# The purpose of this script is to automatically test .C files
# for unnecessary includes by attempting to compile the source
# with specific headers removed.  The expected behavior
# is for the compilation to fail, so if it succeeds that may
# mean you can remove a header from the .C to speed up compilation
# times.  Be sure to double-check or at least know what you are
# doing before just automatically removing header files.
#
# Note: you must give an absolute path to the source file that
# you want to test. For example, if your libmesh source tree is
# located at $LIBMESH_SRC, you could do:
#
# $ cd contrib/bin
# $ ./test_src.sh $LIBMESH_SRC/src/mesh/mesh_base.C
