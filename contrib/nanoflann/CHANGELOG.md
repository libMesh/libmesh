nanoflann 1.5.0: Released Jun 16, 2023
 * **API changes:**
   - Users of radius search should change their result placeholder type:
   `std::vector<std::pair<IndexType, DistanceType>>` => `std::vector<nanoflann::ResultItem<IndexType, DistanceType>>`. (See [#166](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann/issues/166) for the motivation of this change).
   - More concise auxiliary (internal) type name:
     `array_or_vector_selector` -> `array_or_vector`.
   - Remove obsolete parameter `nChecks_IGNORED`. Removed from `SearchParams`
     constructor too, so that structure has been renamed `SearchParameters` to
     enforce users to update the code and avoid mistakes with the order of its
     ctor parameters.
   - Added method RadiusResultSet::empty()
   - Template argument rename: `AccesorType` => `IndexType` (does not actually affect user code at all).
   - Added concurrent tree building support, refer to `KDTreeSingleIndexAdaptorParams::n_thread_build`.
 * **Other changes:**
   - Macros to avoid conflicts with X11 symbols.
   - Inline an auxiliary example function in case users want to use it and
    include the file in multiple translation units (Closes [#182](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann/issues/182)).
   - Move all benchmarking code, data, and scripts to [its own repository](https://github.com/MRPT/nanoflann-benchmark) to keep this repo as clean as possible.
   - Fix "potentially uninitialized" GCC warning.
   - Clarified, even more, in docs and examples, that L2 distances are **squared** distances.
   - Removed the (with modern compilers) now useless `inline` keyword in class members.
   - Add examples with GUI (requires [mrpt-gui](https://docs.mrpt.org/reference/latest/group_mrpt_gui_grp.html)):
     - nanoflann_gui_example_R3: Radius search on RÂ³ Euclidean space.
     - nanoflann_gui_example_bearings: NN search on non-Euclidean spaces.
 * BUGFIXES:
     - Avoid segfault if saving an empty index (Closes [#205](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann/issues/205)).

nanoflann 1.4.3: Released Jul 24, 2022
 * Added flag SkipInitialBuildIndex to allow not wasting time building a tree when it will be loaded from a file later on ([PR #171](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann/pull/171)).

  * Added KDTreeSingleIndexAdaptor::radiusSearchCustomCallback() (Based on a suggestion by Yannick Morin-Rivest)

    the internal pointers.
  * Fixed crash if trying to build an index of an empty dataset.

nanoflann 1.1.7: Released Aug 24, 2013
  * Two internal containers are now automatically defined as fixed-size arrays if the

  * Allow manually setting the path to Eigen3 (mainly for building examples under Windows).

nanoflann 1.1.2: Released May 2, 2012
  * Better documentation and added graphs of a benchmarking for helping choosing "leaf_max_size".
  * Now KDTreeSingleIndexAdaptor::buildIndex() can be called several times
     even when the dataset size changes (Thanks to Rob McDonald for reporting!)

nanoflann 1.1.1: Released Feb 1, 2012
  * Some fixes to kd_tree index and L1/L2 metrics to allow distinct types
     in data elements and in the distances. This is mainly to permit elements
	 being vectors of integers (e.g. uint8_t) but distances being real numbers.
  * Examples and unit tests have been corrected to use template arguments
     instead of being hard-wired to "float" data types (Thanks Thomas Vincent
	 for noticing!).

nanoflann 1.1.0: Released Dec 15, 2011
  * Fixed warnings for MSVC and for GCC with "-Wall -pedantic"
  * Updated performance tests to work with the final nanoflann code (they were
     written for a very early version).
  * All main classes now have new template arguments for the type of indice,
     which now defaults to "size_t" instead of "int". In case this breaks
     backward compatibility in user code, especify "int" to override the default
     template arguments, although "size_t" it's recommended.

nanoflann 1.0.0: Released Aug 30, 2011
  * Initial version
