# Figure out various locations in the src/build tree.
# This is relatively fragile code and is essentially
# specific to netcdf-c. It does, however, have the virtue
# of isolating all this nonsense into one place.
# This will get somewhat simplified (I hope) when
# we move to a separate test_utilities directory

# This code is intended to provide constants
# for accessing various objects in the src/build
# tree(s) across multiple ways of building netcdf-c.
# Currently, the following build situations are supported.
# 1. Autoconf with make check: the src and build trees are the same
# 2. Autoconf with make distcheck: the src and build trees are distinct
# 3. Cmake on a *nix platform using e.g. gcc:
#    the src and build trees are distinct.
# 4. Cmake on windows using cygwin or msys.
#    The src and build trees are distinct.
#
# For now, an explicit build using the Visual C(++) compiler
# is not supported. The big issue is the handling of executables
# and the notion of a VS configuration/build type like Debug or Release.
# When using VS, executables are placed in a subdirectory of the
# build directory. That subdirectory is named by the configuration type.
# Thus one finds ncdump.exe in $top_builddir/ncdump/Debug instead of
# $top_builddir/ncdump. An additional issue is the extension of an
# executable: .exe vs nothing. This code attempts to figure out which is used.
#
# For possible future fixes, a placeholder is left in place in the
# following code named VS. If it were set to the build type, then,
# in theory, this code would work with Visual C. It is disabled for now.
#
# The goal, then, of this common code is to set up some useful
#constants for use in test shell scripts.
# 1. srcdir - absolute path to the source dir (e.g. ${top_srcdir}/ncgen)
# 2. top_srcdir - absolute path to the root of the source
# 3. top_builddir - absolute path to the root of the build directory;
#                   may be same as top_srcdir (e.g. #1).
# 4. builddir - absolute path of th the directory into which generated
#               stuff (.nc, .cdl, etc) is stored.
# 5. execdir - absolute path of the directory into which executables are
#              placed. For all but the VS case, execdir == builddir.
#
# The following are defined to support inter-directory references.
# 6. NCDUMP - absolute path to the ncdump.exe executable
# 7. NCCOPY - absolute path to the nccopy.exe executable
# 8. NCGEN - absolute path to ncgen.exe
# 9. NCGEN3 - absolute path to ncgen3.exe
