NetCDF is a set of software libraries and self-describing,
machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access,
and sharing of array-oriented scientific data. 

<p>NetCDF was developed and is maintained
at <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu">Unidata</a>, part of the
<a href="http://www.ucar.edu">University Corporation for Atmospheric Research</a> (UCAR) <a href="http://www.ucp.ucar.edu">Community
Programs</a> (UCP). Unidata is funded primarily by the National Science
Foundation.

The dispatch interface within the netCDF library allows the netCDF API
to be used for different types of back-ends, for example, the HDF5
library, or a DAP client accessing remote data.
