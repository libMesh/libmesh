/*
 *  File name:    utf8proc.h
 *  Version:      1.1.1
 *  Last changed: 2007-07-22
 *  Changed 2008-05-16 by rkr to add config.h and replacement for stdbool.h
 *                            for pre-C99 compilers that don't support bool.
 *  Changed 2008-06-05 by rkr to add utf8proc_check(str, options) function for
 *                            for just checking UTF-8 validity
 *  Description:
 *  Header files for libutf8proc, which is a mapping tool for UTF-8 strings
 *  with following features:
 *  - decomposing and composing of strings
 *  - replacing compatibility characters with their equivalents
 *  - stripping of "default ignorable characters"
 *    like SOFT-HYPHEN or ZERO-WIDTH-SPACE
 *  - folding of certain characters for string comparison
 *    (e.g. HYPHEN U+2010 and MINUS U+2212 to ASCII "-")
 *    (see "LUMP" option)
 *  - optional rejection of strings containing non-assigned code points
 *  - stripping of control characters
 *  - stripping of character marks (accents, etc.)
 *  - transformation of LF, CRLF, CR and NEL to line-feed (LF)
 *    or to the unicode chararacters for paragraph separation (PS)
 *    or line separation (LS).
 *  - unicode case folding (for case insensitive string comparisons)
 *  - rejection of illegal UTF-8 data
 *    (i.e. UTF-8 encoded UTF-16 surrogates)
 *  - support for korean hangul characters
 *  Unicode Version 5.0.0 is supported.

/*
 *  Flags being regarded by several functions in the library:
 *  NULLTERM:  The given UTF-8 input is NULL terminated.
 *  STABLE:    Unicode Versioning Stability has to be respected.
 *  COMPAT:    Compatibility decomposition
 *             (i.e. formatting information is lost)
 *  COMPOSE:   Return a result with composed characters.
 *  DECOMPOSE: Return a result with decomposed characters.
 *  IGNORE:    Strip "default ignorable characters"
 *  REJECTNA:  Return an error, if the input contains unassigned
 *             code points.
 *  NLF2LS:    Indicating that NLF-sequences (LF, CRLF, CR, NEL) are
 *             representing a line break, and should be converted to the
 *             unicode character for line separation (LS).
 *  NLF2PS:    Indicating that NLF-sequences are representing a paragraph
 *             break, and should be converted to the unicode character for
 *             paragraph separation (PS).
 *  NLF2LF:    Indicating that the meaning of NLF-sequences is unknown.
 *  STRIPCC:   Strips and/or convers control characters.
 *             NLF-sequences are transformed into space, except if one of
 *             the NLF2LS/PS/LF options is given.
 *             HorizontalTab (HT) and FormFeed (FF) are treated as a
 *             NLF-sequence in this case.
 *             All other control characters are simply removed.
 *  CASEFOLD:  Performs unicode case folding, to be able to do a
 *             case-insensitive string comparison.
 *  CHARBOUND: Inserts 0xFF bytes at the beginning of each sequence which
 *             is representing a single grapheme cluster (see UAX#29).
 *  LUMP:      Lumps certain characters together
 *             (e.g. HYPHEN U+2010 and MINUS U+2212 to ASCII "-").
 *             (See lump.txt for details.)
 *             If NLF2LF is set, this includes a transformation of
 *             paragraph and line separators to ASCII line-feed (LF).
 *  STRIPMARK: Strips all character markings
 *             (non-spacing, spacing and enclosing) (i.e. accents)
 *             NOTE: this option works only with COMPOSE or DECOMPOSE
