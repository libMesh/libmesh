This directory contains source code for nctest, an extensive test
program for the entire netCDF library.  Before compiling the sources in
this directory, you must have already made the netCDF library from the
../src directory.

For UNIX, just type "make".  Then, when "nctest" is successfully made,
invoke it with "nctest".

For VMS, type "@make".  The make.com, make.opt, and *-vms files are for
VMS only.  When nctest.exe is successfully made, invoke it with "run
nctest".

Output from the test program should look like the following:
--- Testing nccreate ...
--- Testing ncopen ...
--- Testing ncredef ...
--- Testing ncendef ...
--- Testing ncclose ...
--- Testing ncinquire ...
--- Testing ncsync ...
--- Testing ncabort ...
--- Testing ncdimdef ...
--- Testing ncdimid ...
--- Testing ncdiminq ...
--- Testing ncdimrename ...
--- Testing ncvardef ...
--- Testing ncvarid ...
--- Testing ncvarinq ...
--- Testing ncvarput1 ...
--- Testing ncvarget1 ...
--- Testing ncvarput ...
--- Testing ncvarget ...
--- Testing ncvarrename ...
--- Testing ncattput ...
--- Testing ncattinq ...
--- Testing ncattget ...
--- Testing ncattcopy ...
--- Testing ncattname ...
--- Testing ncattrename ...
--- Testing ncattdel ...
--- Testing nctypelen ...
except that on VMS systems, the line "Doesn't support shared access on
vms" will appear a couple of times after the "ncopen" and "ncsync"
tests.
