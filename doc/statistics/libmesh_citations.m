% Number of "papers using libmesh" by year.
%
% Note 1: this does not count citations "only," the authors must have actually
% used libmesh in part of their work.  Therefore, these counts do not include
% things like Wolfgang citing us in his papers to show how Deal.II is
% superior...
%
% Note 2: I typically update this data after regenerating the web page,
% since bibtex2html renumbers the references starting from "1" each year.
%
% Note 3: These citations include anything that is not a dissertation/thesis.
% So, some are conference papers, some are journal articles, etc.
%
% Note 4: The libmesh paper came out in 2006, but there are some citations
% prior to that date, obviously.  These counts include citations of the
% website libmesh.sf.net as well...
%
% Note 5: Preprints are listed as the "current year + 1" and are constantly
% being moved to their respective years after being published.
