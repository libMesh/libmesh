List of files
-------------
libmesh_all.sh         - Run to regenerate all the "active" statistics plots.

* Active statistics
  libmesh_mailinglists.py - Approximate subscriber counts and mailing list volume, organized
                            chronologically and by month.  Subscriber counts require a password.
  libmesh_citations.py    - Numbers of publications per year, thesis/dissertations and preprints.
                            See doc/citations for more information.
  libmesh_pagehits.py     - Number of visitors to libmesh.github.io, as reported by Google Analytics.
                            Note: you will need a google analytics account (and I will
                            have to give it access) to get these numbers.
  cloc_libmesh.py         - Number of files and lines of source code, as determined by cloc.pl.
  github_traffic.py       - Number of pageviews and unique visitors to the github.com/libmesh/libmesh site.

* Inactive statistics
  libmesh_downloads.py   - Number of downloads per month as reported by sourceforge.net
  libmesh_sflogos.py     - The number of sourceforge "logos" served up due to libmesh web content.
  libmesh_svn.py         - SVN usage for libmesh.  This is now deprecated because we don't use SVN
                           anymore.
