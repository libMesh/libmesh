% A code based on the chain of free open-source software OpenCASCADE
% [70], gmesh [71], libmesh [72], and GSL [73], called
% AGATAGeFEM [74] has also been developed. The
% open-source software is used to model the geometry,
% to create a mesh adapted as a function of the field
% shape for the solving of the partial differential
% equations, to solve these equations, and finally to
% solve the problem of transporting the charges inside
% the crystal and the formation of the signals. The
% response of the preamplifier and cross-talk is
% included. A pulse-shape database calculated using
% this code has yet to be tested with real data.
