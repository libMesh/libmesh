\noindent Some information about this list:
\begin{itemize}
\item The citations can be for anything (journal articles, conference papers, technical
  reports, dissertations, posters, etc.).
\item We do not list items that only \emph{cite} libMesh, the authors must
  have actually \emph{used} LibMesh in part of their work.
\item Conversely, not everyone who uses LibMesh actually cites it, for
  example when it is used through another library or application. We
  also include such papers in this list.
\item The LibMesh paper came out in 2006, but there are some citations
  prior to that date which mainly referred to the old
  \url{libmesh.sf.net} site that existed at the time.
\end{itemize}

%% In the ieeetr format, if you specify a month and an issue number,
%% it prints only the month!
%% The unsrt format, on the other hand, prints both, like this:
%% International Journal of Blah, 13(4):999-1016,November 2009.
%% Another option is the newer IEEEtran, which also seems to print
%% both, and uses a different font for URLs.
