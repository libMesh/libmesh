% Message from Paul Hilscher (paul[at]center.iae.kyoto-u.ac.jp) re this paper:
% I was investigating some alternatives to the Fourier method to solve Poisson's equation.
% One option I investigated was libmesh, but dropped further investigation it in favor of
% HYPRE, as my code  deals only with a rectangular grid this proved to be more efficient.
% Tough, I was quite suppressed by the simplicity and power of libmesh and hope to
% use it soon again in my research project. Keep up the good work !
