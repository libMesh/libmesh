What is this?
-------------
We like to keep track of any publications that actually *use* libmesh
to to obtain results.  It can be any type of publication: conference
talk, poster, refereed article, technical report, user manual,
dissertation, etc.  It's best if it is easily accessible from the web.
We are *not* interested in tracking publications that only mention
libmesh in a laundry list of FEM libraries, although it is nice to
have the citations ;-)



No, I mean what are all the files in this directory?
----------------------------------------------------
A set of bibtex files (named by year, four.bib is from 2004 for
example) and a few others (preprints.bib, theses.bib) which, using the
accompanying Makefile and scripts, can be used to generate a PDF
document or the publications.php page that currently resides at
http://libmesh.sf.net/publications.php.  These scripts started life as
something I [JWP] personally maintained, but have now been
transitioned into the source repository, just in case I get hit by a
bus.



OK, so what can I do?
--------------------
* Add a new reference:
  Choose one of the templates in templates.bib, copy it to the appropriate
  year (or theses.bib or preprints.bib if appropriate) and fill in the
  relevant details.

* Generate a PDF:
  Type 'make libmesh_refs'.  Assuming you have a reasonably modern
  version of LaTeX installed, it will produce a file called libmesh_refs.pdf
  with all the references organized by year.  This is mostly useful for
  checking that your citation renders correctly (accents, etc.) in PDF.

* Update the publications.php site:
  You must have bibtex2html installed, grab it here:
  https://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/bibtex2html I built from source, but
  the binaries might also work for you.  Once that's installed and in
  your PATH, run the ./create_website.sh script.  Several files will
  be generated, the main one is called publications.php.  You may be
  able to view it locally by renaming it to publications.html and
  pointing your browser at file:///path/to/publications.html.  Once
  you are satisfied with the results, you can upload them to the
  libmesh site (assuming your sf account name is jimbob and you are a
  developer on the libmesh project) by doing:

  sftp jimbob,libmesh@web.sf.net
  cd htdocs
  put publications.php



Any other tips I should know?
-----------------------------
* I use preprints.bib primarily as a "TODO" list for citations that are
  available online, but are still lacking some piece of information, such
  as journal issue, page numbers, etc.

* If you have any problems running the script, or if you have a reference
  you want added, please let me know (jwpeterson at gmail).
